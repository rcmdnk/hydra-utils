Wrapper for ([hydra-core](https://pypi.org/project/hydra-core/) to add flexible configuration treatment.

## Requirement

- Python 3.13, 3.12, 3.11, 3.10

## Installation

```bash
pip install hydra-utils
```

## Usage

```python
@hydra_utils.hydra_wrapper(
    app_name='my_app', app_version='0.1.0', app_file=__file__
)
def main(conf: dict[Any, Any]) -> None: ...


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

- `app_name` and `app_version` are used to log information of current version.
  - It is useful if app_version is set to `__version__` of the app.
- `app_file` is used to check the file place's git status to log the git commit hash and diff from the last commit.
- The argument which the main function takes is `dict[Any, Any]` instead of `DictConfig`.
- Configuration file can be passed by the first argument or `conf=...` at the command line.
- Configuration file can have `include` keyword which has the list of configuration files to include.
  - Included files are merged to the main configuration file.
  - It is resolved at the place of `include`. If the main file has other configurations after the `include`, they will overwrite the included configurations.
- `n_jobs` is fixed to the number of CPUs.
  - It is used to set the number of jobs for parallel processing.
  - If `n_jobs` is set to 0 or 1, it is set to 1.
  - If `n_jobs` is set to -1, it is set to the number of logical cores.
  - If `n_jobs` is set to None, it is set to the number of physical cores.
  - If `n_jobs` is set to a negative number, it is set to the number of logical cores + 1 + n_jobs, i.e. -1 is the same as the number of logical cores.

There is also wrapper function for `to_absolute_path`.

```python
from hydra_utils import to_absolute_path
```

- It returns empty string if the input is empty.
- It returns the input as is if the input includes `:` (e.g., `http://`, `s3://`, ...).
